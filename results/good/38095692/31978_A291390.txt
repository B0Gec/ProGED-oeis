While total time consumed by now, scale:31979/34371, seq_id:A291390, order:20 took:
 2.3 seconds, i.e. 0.04 minutes or 0.001 hours.

A291390: 
a(n) = 25*a(n - 7) + 25*a(n - 6) - 10*a(n - 5) - 24*a(n - 3) - 26*a(n - 2) + 11*a(n - 1)
truth: 
a(n) = 10*a(n - 1) + -15*a(n - 2) + -50*a(n - 3) + -25*a(n - 4),  
a(0) = 2, a(1) = 17, a(2) = 130, a(3) = 940

False  -  checked against website ground truth.     
True  -  "manual" check if equation is correct.
